#
# Script to generate a report based on the last Appsignal deploy marker.
#
# The script will obtain the time of the last deploy from AppSignal and then
# pull metrics for the time around that deploy (1 hour before to 1 hour after).
# Based on these metrics it will calculate changes in response time, error rate
# and throughput, possibly caused by the deploy.
# The 20 minutes around the deploy are ignored to account for errors or slow
# requests caused by service restarts or cold caches.
#
# Pull up the help message to learn about the usage of this script:
#
#         ./bin/appsignal_report_deploy --help
